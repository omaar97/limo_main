Solution for the Robot Programming assignment by Omar Faris (Student ID# 28042200)

## Abstract:

This work presents a pothole detector for two simulated scenarios in Gazebo and ROS2 using AgileX LIMO robot. In the first scenario, the potholes in a simple world with purple potholes are detected by finding the contours of purple features in the robot RGB camera images. The second scenario involves finding potholes in a realistic world by identifying unique edges that the robot is observing. The robot navigates autonomously across the whole mapped world during the task regardless of its starting position by following waypoints in the map. A report about the potholes is generated after completing the task.
